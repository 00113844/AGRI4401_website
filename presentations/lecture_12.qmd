## Introduction & Objectives
- Scope of precision agriculture  
- Frameworks for technology adoption  
- Capital budgeting methods: NPV & IRR  
- Case study application & sensitivity analysis  

---

## Precision Agriculture Overview
- Definition: data-driven farm management using advanced technologies  
- Key technologies: GPS machinery; aerial drones; soil & crop sensors; VRA systems  
- Benefits: yield optimization; input-cost reduction; environmental sustainability  

---

## Unique Characteristics of Agricultural Markets
- Seasonality & biological cycles  
- High capital intensity & long payback periods  
- Fragmented land ownership & scale constraints  
- Weather dependency & environmental factors  

---

## Comparative Adoption Dynamics
- Lower risk tolerance due to livelihood dependence  
- Limited financing options for smallholders  
- Slower diffusion; peer influence is critical  
- Strong regulatory & ecological constraints  

---

## Technology Adoption Strategies
- Demonstrations & field trials to reduce perceived risk  
- Financing models: leasing; subsidies; group purchasing  
- Farmer education & technical support programs  
- Collaborations: equipment manufacturers; agronomists; cooperatives  

---

## Technology Adoption Models
- Rogers’ Diffusion: innovators → early adopters → early majority → late majority → laggards  
- TOE Framework: technological, organizational & environmental contexts  
- Key factors: relative advantage; compatibility; complexity; trialability; observability  

---

## Investment Analysis Concepts
- Capital budgeting: long-term investments in equipment & systems  
- Time value of money: discount future cash flows  
- Cash-flow components: initial outlay (C₀); annual benefits (Cₜ); salvage value  
- Discount rate: WACC & project-specific risk premiums  

---

## Net Present Value (NPV)
- Definition: sum of discounted cash flows minus initial investment  
- Formula: NPV = ∑ₜ₌₁ᵀ (Cₜ / (1 + r)ᵗ) – C₀  
- Decision rule: accept if NPV > 0  
- Pros: accounts for time value; provides absolute value measure  
- Cons: sensitive to discount rate; requires accurate cash-flow estimates  

---

## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- Definition: discount rate that makes NPV zero  
- Formula: 0 = ∑ₜ₌₁ᵀ (Cₜ / (1 + IRR)ᵗ) – C₀  
- Decision rule: accept if IRR > hurdle rate  
- Limitations: multiple IRRs with non-conventional cash flows; scale & timing distortions  

---

## Case Study: NPV Calculation
- Project: purchase of variable-rate fertilizer applicator  
- C₀ = $150,000; Cₜ = $40,000/year for 6 years; r = 8%  
- NPV = –150000 + ∑ₜ₌₁⁶ (40000 / 1.08ᵗ)  
- If NPV > 0, the investment is financially viable  

---

## Case Study: IRR Calculation
- Same cash flows as NPV example  
- Solve 0 = –150000 + ∑ₜ₌₁⁶ (40000 / (1 + IRR)ᵗ) for IRR  
- Use Excel’s IRR function or a financial calculator  
- Accept if IRR > 8% hurdle rate  

---

## Sensitivity Analysis & Conclusions
- Scenarios: discount rates of 6%, 8%, 10%; benefits of $36k (–10%) & $44k (+10%); project life of 5–7 years  
- Evaluate NPV & IRR under each scenario; identify break-even points  
- Recommendations: pilot trials; targeted training; flexible financing schemes  
- Ongoing monitoring: update cash-flow estimates & revisit analysis as conditions change
