## Soil & Water Spatial Variability

- Spatial vs temporal variability: definitions and implications  
- Soil texture: particle-size distribution affecting water-holding, nutrient retention, and root growth  
- Soil structure: aggregation patterns influencing aeration, water infiltration, and seasonal moisture dynamics  
- Mapping methods: electromagnetic induction (ECa) for texture proxies and gamma radiometrics for structural heterogeneity  
- Seasonal effects: how moisture fluctuation alters conductivity and radiometric signatures  
- Variability pattern analysis as basis for management zone delineation  

::: notes
Spatial variability describes cross-field differences in soil properties, while temporal variability tracks changes over time due to factors like rainfall, crop uptake, and tillage.  
Soil texture, defined by clay, silt and sand fractions, strongly controls water-holding capacity, cation exchange capacity and root penetration; ECa sensors capture spatial texture variability by measuring apparent soil electrical conductivity correlating with clay content.  
Soil structure refers to the arrangement of aggregates, pore connectivity and bulk density, which govern aeration, infiltration rates and moisture redistribution; gamma radiometric surveys can detect variability in potassium, uranium and thorium distributions associated with structural changes.  
Seasonal moisture dynamics influence both ECa and radiometric readings, requiring calibration to separate true structural heterogeneity from temporary water-content effects.  
Analyzing the magnitude and spatial pattern of these variations enables the creation of management zones that optimize irrigation, fertilization and other inputs to improve resource use efficiency and yield consistency.

## Agenda

- Precision Agriculture & Site-Specific Nutrient Management Overview  
- 4R Nutrient Stewardship Framework (Right Product, Rate, Place, Time)  
- Grid Soil Sampling & Spatial Data Acquisition  
- Geostatistical Interpolation Methods (Kriging, IDW, Cokriging)  
- Prescription Map Generation & GNSS-Guided Variable-Rate Application  
- Monitoring, PDCA Cycle & Feedback for Continuous Optimization  

::: notes
This agenda slide provides the high-level structure for our deep dive into precision nutrient management. We begin with an overview of site-specific nutrient management and its role in precision agriculture. Next, we cover the 4R framework, which underpins sustainable fertilizer practices by ensuring the right product is applied at the right rate, place, and time. We then discuss systematic grid soil sampling protocols and spatial data acquisition using GPS/GNSS. The fourth section explores geostatistical methods—kriging, IDW, cokriging—to transform point measurements into continuous nutrient maps. The fifth topic covers prescription map generation and GNSS-guided variable-rate application equipment. Finally, we address monitoring strategies (remote sensing, PDCA cycle) to refine nutrient prescriptions for agronomic and environmental performance.

## Soil Formation & Landscape Variability

- Multi-scale soil and crop variability mapping: expert surveys, digital soil mapping, proximal/remote sensing, yield mapping  
- Strategic, tactical, operational decision levels for low- and high-tech systems  
- Management unit delineation based on pedogenic factors and landscape morphology  
- ICT-driven spatial integration linking soil heterogeneity to crop growth and input scheduling  
- Site-specific nutrient and water application to minimize leaching, runoff, and GHGs  
- Economic optimization through precision targeting of inputs to variable-rate zones  

::: notes
Soil formation is governed by climate, organisms, topography, parent material, and time—creating pronounced variability. In precision agriculture, we delineate management units at strategic (whole-field), tactical (zones), and operational (grid/prescription) scales. We fuse traditional surveys, DSM, and sensors with yield data to characterize texture, organic matter, moisture, and fertility. ICT platforms integrate these spatial datasets with crop and nutrient models to prescribe variable inputs—enhancing resource stewardship and economic returns.

## Key Formation Processes

```{mermaid}
graph TD
  A[Climate] --> F(Soil Formation)
  B[Organisms] --> F
  C[Relief] --> F
  D[Parent Material] --> F
  E[Time] --> F
```

- Climate: chemical & physical weathering rates  
- Organisms: organic matter inputs & bioturbation  
- Relief: erosion, drainage, deposition  
- Parent material: mineralogy, texture, pH  
- Time: horizon differentiation & pedogenesis  
- CLORPT factors as spatial covariates  

::: notes
Hans Jenny’s CLORPT model captures how Climate, Organisms, Relief, Parent material, and Time interact to form soils. In precision agriculture, we quantify these as digital covariates (climate indices, DEMs, lithology, time series) and feed them into machine-learning frameworks (e.g., SVM), using Moran’s I for feature selection.

## Weathering & Horizon Development

:::

:::

::: notes
Chemical weathering transforms silicates through hydrolysis, oxidation, and solution reactions, affecting texture and nutrients. Physical weathering increases surface area. Biological agents accelerate dissolution. Horizons form sequentially: O (organic), A (biologically active), B (illuviation), C (weathered parent). Understanding these layers is crucial for modeling water, nutrients, and roots in decision-support tools.
:::

---

## Organic Matter Accumulation

- Organic matter enhances soil structure & CEC  
- Humus content correlates with higher ECa  
- Organic-rich zones map distinctly on ECa surveys  
- Decomposition alters moisture retention & conductivity  
- Overlaps with anthropogenic management zones  
- ECa surveys delineate organic gradients for VRA  

::: notes
Organic matter influences soil dielectric properties and ion-exchange capacity, raising ECa. Seasonal decomposition shifts water retention, altering ECa peaks in residue-rich areas. Mapping these zones guides variable-rate composts, manures, and cover crops—boosting carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling.

:::

:::

::: notes
Structure regulates infiltration, retention, and root growth. Proximal sensors map porosity and bulk density. Compaction zones require targeted tillage or amendments. Aggregate stability links to organic carbon and informs cover-cropping strategies.
:::

---

## Soil Porosity & Density

- Porosity: void fraction controlling aeration, water, roots  
- Bulk density: mass per volume, inversely related to porosity  
- Core & gamma-ray methods for direct measurement  
- ECa sensitivity to density via dielectric coupling  
- Heterogeneity drives mapping resolution  
- Use for precision tillage & irrigation zoning  

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR

```

::: notes
Porosity and bulk density are key for water & roots. Direct methods are low throughput; ECa offers field-scale proxies. Density maps + yield data guide tillage and irrigation decisions.
:::

---

## Spatial Variability of Physical Properties

- Texture heterogeneity impacts water & nutrients  
- Aggregate stability & pore connectivity vary spatially  
- Bulk density & compaction hotspots alter roots & aeration  
- Infiltration & retention capacity create moisture gradients  
- Topographic gradients drive erosion & deposition  
- Geostatistical methods (variogram, kriging) define zones  

::: notes
Even single fields exhibit strong spatial variability in texture, structure, and density. Geostatistics turn point samples into continuous maps for management zone delineation.

```
:::

::::

::: notes
Macropores drive infiltration and aeration; micropores retain plant-available water. Mapping pore size distributions guides irrigation scheduling and water-balance models.
:::

---

## Soil Compaction & Traffic Farming

- Controlled Traffic Farming confines wheels to lanes, preventing subsoil compaction (>0.3 MPa @ 400 mm)  
- Preserves macroporosity & root penetration  
- Eliminates deep tillage energy costs  
- Improves infiltration, reduces runoff, erosion, GHGs  
- GNSS-guided implements ensure precise lane alignment

::: notes
ECa correlates (R²>0.7) with nutrient levels. Interpolated ECa surfaces guide targeted sampling and VRA fertilizer—reducing inputs by 10–20% with no yield loss.
:::

---

## Cation Exchange Capacity

- CEC: capacity to retain/exchange Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, K⁺, Na⁺  
- Units: cmol(+)/kg or meq/100 g  
- Governs nutrient buffering & leaching risk  
- Spatial mapping via grid sampling + cokriging  
- Informs 4R management: rate & placement  
- Enhances fertilizer efficiency  

::: notes
CEC reflects negative charge on clays & OM. Grid samples + cokriging produce high-res CEC maps feeding the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. Aligns with 4R for optimized nutrient retention.
:::
